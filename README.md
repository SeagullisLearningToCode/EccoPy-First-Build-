# EccoPy-First-Build-
This is the "first" build of EccoPY, before I called this EccoPY this was a subproject within a bigger project called "Move or Tear" using the Pygame module
and it was the first instance of me using user-control instead of the computer doing all the work which later became EccoPY, as you can see that there is things
or pieces pf code that are inherited from Move and Tear.

# Why name it Move and Simp?
Move and Simp is a version of move or tear but more simplier to use, EccoPY is in this version

# Is there more Sub-projects in this project?
Yes, but there just simple things I was testing.
